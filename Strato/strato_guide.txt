connect to head node: 
	map locahost:8000 to 10.92.0.188:8787 by running ssh -L 8000:localhost:8787 ubuntu@10.92.0.188 -i HSBKeyPair.pem
	map locahost:8001 to 10.92.0.188:8786 by running ssh -L 8001:localhost:8786 ubuntu@10.92.0.188 -i HSBKeyPair.pem
start dask scheduler on head-node: 
	dask-scheduler
log on compute nodes and run: dask-worker 10.92.0.188:8786 & (& will give the PID such that we kan use "kill" to stop worker)
	ssh ubuntu@10.92.0.98 -i HSBKeyPair.pem
	ssh ubuntu@10.92.0.74 -i HSBKeyPair.pem
	ssh ubuntu@10.92.0.75 -i HSBKeyPair.pem
	ssh ubuntu@10.92.0.525 -i HSBKeyPair.pem
	
Dask dashboard: in browser - locahost:8000
To use cluster in dask set client = Client("locahost:8001") and run dask program
